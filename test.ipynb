This includes a review of the history of Information Technology globally, - from pre-historic era all the way to today’s advances on the field of IT – and similarly in the Philippines. The historical survey, which is grounded on basic IT concepts, will examine how these developments have affected the course in human society: politically, economically, and socially (including culturally). The second part of the course focuses on current issues arising from the application of information technology, how such applications relate to ethical and political decisions in both public and private sectors, and their effects (positive and negative) on society and life in general. \"\n",
